# -python-function-assignment-2
In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python. The prompts have been listed below. Work must be completed using a local code editor, and should be pushed to GitHub. Be sure to submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas when you are finished.

For each of the functions described below, plan the best way to write the function. Remember that there may be a recursive and an iterative solution to many problems. The best solution to any problem is the solution that you understand best. As long as your function is named correctly, accepts the correct parameters, and returns the correct output, you can be confident that you have succeeded at your task.
